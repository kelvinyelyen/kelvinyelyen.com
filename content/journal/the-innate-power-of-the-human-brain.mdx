Undoubtedly, a latent power resides within our brains, but our challenge lies in accessing and utilizing this potential effectively, resulting in a decline in our cognitive abilities in modern times. Over history, our brains evolved to face challenges, possessing a raw power akin to our ancestors. However, each advancement introduces new challenges, leading to a dwindling of our cognitive prowess. This has buried valuable innate abilities, like intuition, deep within our minds.

The information age propelled humanity forward but came at a cost: we sacrificed some innate capabilities for an overwhelming influx of information and its accompanying complexities (see [Complexity & Human Thinking](/blog/complexities-of-human-thinking-evolution)). We now face difficulties in handling these complexities and tapping into our latent abilities, which would require substantial time and dedication for exploration. Consequently, we tend to rely on simplistic and conventional ideas.

> The only solution lies in learning to quell the anxiety that arises when confronted with anything complex or chaotic.

As expressed in Robert Greene's book "Mastery‚Äù.

It can be argued that technology and inventions serve as extensions of our brains. However, we have primarily focused on these inventions, neglecting the development of our consciousness and crucial abilities that will prove essential in the future, as highlighted by Yuval Noah Harari.
