summary: Andrew Lampinen's expert insights ignited my passion for cognitive computing

The path of exploration is rarely linear, especially when you have a diverse range of interests. With a foundation in computer science and a curiosity about technology, I’ve often found myself standing at the crossroads of several possibilities. I found myself drawn to the crossroads of neuroscience and computational sciences, where cognitive computing quietly emerges.

Last September, through the Deep Indaba Mentorship on Career Planning, I had the opportunity to connect with [Andrew Lampinen](https://lampinen.github.io/), Senior Research Scientist at DeepMind. Our conversation opened my eyes to the nuances of Cognitive Computing, Computational Neuroscience, and Computational Cognitive Science—areas that intertwine more deeply than I had imagined. Andrew’s insights clarified the connections and boundaries between these disciplines, sparking my curiosity about their combined potential.

His advice was simple yet subtle: dedicate time to truly absorb a concept, then apply it. This cyclical process—study, then practice—mirrors the way true understanding forms. His emphasis on engaging with hands-on projects and being part of the research community resonated with me deeply. It’s through doing that we uncover deeper truths, and in sharing, we all grow.

In the end, Andrew’s guidance wasn’t just about navigating the field of cognitive science; it was about navigating the broader journey of discovery itself. It’s a journey where the lines between computation, cognition, and consciousness blur, and where every step feels like the beginning of something much larger than any one of us.
