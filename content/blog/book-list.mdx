My childhood hobby of reading has evolved into a lifelong passion. My choices of books are greatly influenced by my fascination with Arts and Culture, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Technology, and other related subjects. Nevertheless, I am always willing to explore any book, regardless of its genre, for I believe that every book holds a unique perspective to be discovered. So, feel free to suggest readsâ€”I'm eager to discuss and discover new perspectives.
