My childhood hobby of reading has evolved into a lifelong passion. My choices of books are greatly influenced by my fascination with Arts and Culture, Philosophy, Neuroscience, Technology, and other related subjects. Nevertheless, I am always willing to explore any book, regardless of its genre, for I believe that every book holds a unique perspective to be discovered. So, feel free to suggest reads—I'm eager to discuss and discover new perspectives.

## 2024 Reading-List

One of my favourite things to do is curating books to read within a specific timeframe. Last year, my goal was to read at least 10 books, and I'm thrilled to have accomplished that. Reading for pleasure or to gain new knowledge is always an enriching experience. This year, I decided to push myself further. Initially aiming for 15 books regardless of my unpredictable schedule, I ended up surpassing that target, and truthfully, I'm not mad at it. Last year, I missed out on reading more due to pointless distractions and time-wasting activities. This time around, I'm determined to regain control and channel my focus towards things I truly enjoy, not just limited to books. My reading list comprises various genres—both fiction and non-fiction. For non-fiction, most books focus on professional and personal growth, while for fiction, I've expanded beyond my usual preferences. There's a deliberate effort to diversify, exploring different authors and settings to broaden my reading horizons...
