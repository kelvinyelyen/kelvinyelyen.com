Exploring a diverse range of interests can be a bittersweet experience. With a background in computer science and a passionate curiosity about technology, deciding on a singular path can be challenging. With an interest in neuroscience and my background in the computational sciences, I came across the intersection of these two fields: cognitive computing.

## Meeting with Andrew Lampinen

To further my understanding of this field and in that matter this aspect of my interest, I had the opportunity last September through Deep Indaba Mentorship on career planning to virtually meet with a domain expert, [Andrew Lampinen](https://lampinen.github.io/), a Senior Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/).

### Insights and Guidance

During my conversation with Andrew, I gained valuable insights into the domains of Cognitive Computing, Computational Neuroscience, and Computational Cognitive Science. Andrew's expertise not only provided clarity on the boundaries and overlaps of these disciplines but also ignited my curiosity about their potential synergies and applications.

What truly ignites my enthusiasm within this interdisciplinary convergence is the immense scope for innovation. The prospect of employing computational methodologies to unravel the complexities of human cognition is both thrilling and offers an expansive array of possibilities.

### Learning Strategy

One standout aspect of the conversation was Andrew's suggestion of an impactful learning strategy: dedicating a week to comprehensively studying a concept, technique, or theory, and subsequently allocating another week to actively applying this acquired knowledge. This hands-on approach promises not just understanding but true mastery.

Andrew also stressed the importance of diving into specific projects and fully immersing oneself in a research area. This approach, he explained, goes beyond traditional learning, allowing for the gradual honing of skills essential for meaningful contributions in these fields.

### Community Engagement

Moreover, his suggestion to engage in research workshops and craft concise research papers struck a chord with me. This collaborative environment fosters a sense of community, encourages the sharing of ideas, and offers opportunities for growth and contribution within this dynamic field.

### Conclusion
Andrew's guidance has become my guiding light, steering me toward a journey of discovery, practical application, and the potential to drive progress in cognitive science. It's an exhilarating prospect, promising not just learning but a chance to make a real impact in these exciting and evolving fields.
