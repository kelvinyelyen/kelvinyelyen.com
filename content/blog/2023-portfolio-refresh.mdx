summary: Thought process, experimentation

I enjoy experimenting with various technologies on my personal website, utilizing it as a sandbox for various Next.js projects, consistently pushing boundaries to explore and test different tools and approaches. This website was entirely constructed from the ground up, continually evolving through migrations that integrate a blend of newly discovered technologies and libraries.

Last week, I made significant updates to ensure better performance and functionality. Motivated by Lee Robinson's advice regarding the significance of documenting project updates, I decided to document the newly added functional and performance features. 

With this new update I focused on two main areas: 
- Content Management 
- Performance. 

## Content Management 
Initially, my website was built using Next.js and a CMS. Selecting the right CMS was tricky due to the complexities involved. Eventually, I chose GhostCMS for its simplicity and convenient JavaScript Content API, which made integration quick and easy as compared to the others. 


However, challenges with GhostCMS affected data formatting. Limited control over HTML data required substantial front-end styling. TThis highlighted the impact of the Ghost API on data handling and the effort needed for front-end design. Also, Ghost’s membership functionality isn't currently compatible with headless setups, potentially limiting expansion into memberships.

Recently, I contemplated migrating away from GhostCMS, considering alternative CMS options, including leveraging Notion's API. After comprehensive analysis, I opted for MDX—a developer-centric solution that addresses limitations encountered with GhostCMS, providing tailored flexibility for my requirements.

### MDX
MDX (Markdown eXtended) combines Markdown and JSX syntax, offering enhanced flexibility for creating customizable components. It allows direct inclusion of JSX components within content, enabling dynamic content creation that combines Markdown with JSX. Also, you can further enhance its capabilities using plugins such as `rehype` and `remark` for additional feature expansions.

#### Setting up for Next.js
While Next's package `@next/mdx` is a viable option, I chose `@next-remote-mdx` due to its expanded capabilities. Additionally, I utilized <ColoredSpan color="#448CF1">`gray-matter`</ColoredSpan> to enable metadata parsing within MDX.

import { Callout } from '@components/callout.jsx' 

# Hello, MDX with Gray Matter!

This is a **paragraph** in MDX. You can use _Markdown_ syntax here.

- Here's a list item.
- And another one.

<Callout>
    Callout Text	
</Callout>
```

MDX allows direct inclusion of JSX components within content, as demonstrated with `<Callout></Callout>`, combining Markdown with JSX for dynamic content creation.

#### Processing .mdx files
Here's a snippet illustrating the handling and processing of .mdx files within a Next.js environment for blog content:

```jsx
// JavaScript code handling .mdx files

import fs from "fs"
import path from "path"
import matter from "gray-matter"

import { formatTimeAgo, formatDateTimeFull } from "./dates"

// Functions for file handling and content retrieval
const Dir = "content/blog"

function generateSlugsFromFiles() {
  const files = fs.readdirSync(path.join(bDir))

  const paths = files.map((filename) => ({
    slug: filename.replace(".mdx", ""),
  }))

  return paths
}

function getPost({ slug }) {
  const markdownFile = fs.readFileSync(
    path.join(Dir, slug + ".mdx"),
    "utf-8"
  )
  const { data: frontMatter, content } = matter(markdownFile)
  return {
    metadata: {
      ...frontMatter,
      publishedAtFormatted: formatDateTimeFull(frontMatter.publishedAt),
    },
    slug,
    content,
  }
}
// ...

export { generateSlugsFromFiles, getPost, getBlogContent }
```

This set of functions exemplifies the handling and processing of .mdx files within a Next.js environment for managing blog content. By utilizing these functions, we can generate slugs, retrieve specific posts, and acquire sorted blog content efficiently.
