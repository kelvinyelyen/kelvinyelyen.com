Human thinking and evolution have led to an abundance of complexity in our understanding of the world. Over time, we have developed increasingly complex layers of meaning attached to concepts that have evolved alongside our own cognitive abilities. As human societies developed, so did the need for more intricate and sophisticated ways of thinking and communicating. This led to the creation of complex systems of language, culture, and belief that have become deeply ingrained in our collective consciousness. However, the downside of this evolution is that it has also led to the development of prejudices, biases, and misunderstandings. The meanings attached to concepts are not always universally understood, and this can result in misinterpretation and conflict. In some cases, this has led to the development of harmful social norms, such as discrimination against certain groups of people.

This evolution of thought and understanding has enabled us to derive greater meaning and purpose from the natural world around us. As humans, we were once merely animals, living within the natural food chain and surviving through birth and death. However, our cognitive capacity afforded us the ability to develop a higher sense of consciousness, and with that came new concepts, social norms, and constructs: monogamy, polygamy, morality and the like.

As our understanding of the world around us has grown, so too has our ability to adapt and cope with its challenges. This has resulted in the creation of ever-more complex systems of beliefs and behaviors that shape our understanding of ourselves and the world we inhabit. Despite the growing complexities, nature appears to have a way of balancing things out.

It is important for humans to continue to critically examine and challenge our thinking constructs and societal norms, and to strive for a better understanding of the world and our place in it. This requires us to be mindful of our biases and to constantly question the assumptions that underlie our beliefs and actions.
